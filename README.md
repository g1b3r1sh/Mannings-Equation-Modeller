# Manning's Equation Modeller
![Screenshot of program on the results screen](/docs/screenshots/readme.png?raw=true "Program Screenshot")
Application that models the Manning's Equation, allowing the user to input river cross-section data to create a model that calculates water elevation and velocity as a function of discharge.

As part of my assessment in the International Baccalaureate Computer Science Higher Level course, I created a Java application that calculated values relating to river cross-sections that are used in hydraulic analysis. My final grade in this course, which comprised of the grades awarded to this project and to the final exams I wrote, was a 7/7.
