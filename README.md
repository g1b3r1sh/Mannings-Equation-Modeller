As part of my assessment in the International Baccalaureate Computer Science Higher Level course, I created a Java application that calculated values relating to river cross-sections that are used in hydraulic analysis. My final grade in this course, which comprised of the grades awarded to this project and to the final exams I wrote, was a 7/7.
