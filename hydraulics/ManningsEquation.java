/**
 * Represents an instance of the Manning's equation
 * The Manning's equation is an equation used to calculate the discharge of a cross-section of a river
 * When combined with the discharge formula Q = VA, it can also be used to calculate the velocity of a cross-section
 * Variables must be initialized before they are used, otherwise, methods will throw a NullPointerException
